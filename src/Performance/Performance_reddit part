##This one works,about getting contents from reddit

library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)
#use the jsonlite package to organize this data into a data frame
#enter the URL plus .json to get contents

btc <- jsonlite::fromJSON('https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/.json')
btc2 <- jsonlite::fromJSON('https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/.json')

#In order to do this we want to declare a variable (in this case df1),
#we want to get that dataset in that list by using the $ in between the names stated above, below is exactly how to do this

df1 <- btc$data$children$data
df2 <- btc2$data$children$data


#Now letâ€™s say we wanted to take only a few of the column names, well first we want to see which columns we want to take out, 
#in this case I want to extract the ups, title, subreddit and url column names, to do this we do the following
new1 = df1[ ,c('ups', 'title', 'subreddit', 'url')]
new2 = df2[ ,c('ups', 'title', 'subreddit', 'url')]

alldata <- rbind(new1, new2)

alldatasorted <-alldata[order(-alldata$ups),]
